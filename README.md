# DGL113 Course Project
1. This is the initial DGL113 project repository readme file. When you view this file, it means you have accepted the project and cloned the initial repository. There is no starting file other than this readme for the project. You will create your own files based on your proposal and design, add them to the docs/ folder, then push your work back to GitHub.
1. Write your project proposal directly in this file in the section below. At a minimum, you should describe what a website you are going to work on and the 3 features that you plan to implement. See the project description on Brightspace for more details.
1. <b>This part of the project is due Mon. Feb. 26 at 11:59pm.</b>
## Project Proposal


--> Project summary
State what site you have chosen to redesign and build (include the URL)

I chose the site from a Church in Courtenay. I worked in this project in the HTML and CSS Course, last term. 

What is the most important purpose of this website:

This site was created with the aim to show the Church, its thoughts, and positions known, and also to be useful in attracting people seeking a place for spiritual growth.

The site of this Christian church seeks to provide the necessary information for people, believers or not, interested in spiritual growth, telling their thoughts, spiritual foundations, creed, ministries and activities. 

Additionally, it seeks to offer contact information and location, as a means to respond to inquiries, offer help or simply to inform about meeting times and spaces. It would be ideal if people had the desire to understand and know more about the church and/or the faith. That they can feel comfortable and see that the church can be a safe and comfortable place to explore spirituality.

--> JavaScript Features

- Form Validation: Validate data entered by users in forms. This helps ensure that correct data is provided before sending the information to the server.

- JavaScript events: By responding to user actions, such as clicks, scroll, and mouse movements to create small animations on cards and/or images.

- Hero animation: Adapt a carousel of images that also throws verses in a random way to make dynamic the home page of the site.


----------

--> Understanding that the validation that I expected to do of the form can be done by HTML, I propose to change this feature by a system of verses that will show different verses every day/hour.
